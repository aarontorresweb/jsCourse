    <title>JS Coding Challenge: Sec 11 CC 4</title>
  </head>

  <body>
    <p>This is a coding challenge to "Section 11: Working with Arrays" from Jonas's Schmedtmann's Complete Javascript Course.</p>
    <p>I wrote this code while working with his instructional videos to practice working with arrays.</p>
    <p>Look in the console to see the output, and in the script.js file to see the javascript and explanation of the code's goal.</p>
    <p> Thanks for checking it out! :)</p>
